Music Player Daemon (MPD) for Android
=====================================

This is a port of mpd, that allows compilation using the android ndk toolchain.
There is no native audio output yet for android, but network output modules
will work.

You can use the compile-android.sh script to compile mpd and a couple of key
dependencies. Be sure to adjust the NDK path at the top.
